                <h2>Tips to Barter</h2>
                <p>Bartering is the process of obtaining goods or services by direct exchange without the use of currency as a medium.
                In times of economic instability or currency devaluation, It can be a great way to ensure the flow of necessary items and services into your household without using precious funds.
                Historically, Face-to-face exchange between familiar parties were most common, but the internet has opened up a new medium for bartering opportunities for both person to person and third-party facilitated transactions. </p>
                <p>There are a number of rules to follow for bartering for a reasons of both safety and courtesy: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Remember, Safety First.</strong> Don't be afraid to ask someone to come with you to an exchange, and meet people in public places as much as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Always Be Inquisitive.</strong> You will never know how wonderful farm-fresh eggs taste if you never asked for a trade.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider all the Goods and Services at Your Disposal.</strong> if you go in thinking of only one thing you are willing to trade, you will miss out on great opportunity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Skeptical when Necessary.</strong> People may offer professional services- even legal or medical- that do not seem legit. If you would not pay that particular person for their services, do not barter with then either.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Barter Something you Don't want to Give.</strong> If your friend is trying to get you to trade Grandma's hand-crocheted baby blanket, you can simply walk away. you should never trade something you will later regret.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Barter for Something you Don't Want.</strong> Unless you are trying to salvage the pride of a friend who wont take charity, there is no reason to accept goods or services that are unnecessary or unwanted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test items to be sure they Work.</strong>But remember, there are no guarantees. An item that powers up may still have a dying battery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Blame the other Party for a Bad Trade.</strong> You can always decline a trade, so that responsibility is yours. you may not have made the best decision, but the same thing happens when making a retail purchase.</li>
                </ul>
